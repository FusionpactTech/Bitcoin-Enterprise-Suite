# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

Security is our highest priority in the Bitcoin Enterprise Suite. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability disclosure process, and guidelines for maintaining the security of our libraries.

## üîí Security Principles

### 1. **Security by Design**
- All libraries are designed with security as a fundamental requirement
- Threat modeling is performed for all major features
- Zero-trust architecture principles are applied throughout

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults and secure coding practices
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### 3. **Cryptographic Excellence**
- Industry-standard cryptographic implementations
- Regular review by cryptography experts
- Quantum-resistant algorithms where applicable

### 4. **Transparency and Accountability**
- Open-source development with public code review
- Comprehensive audit trails and logging
- Regular third-party security audits

## üö® Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Email**: Send details to [Security@fusionpact.com](mailto:Security@fusionpact.com)
2. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive communications (Key ID: 3mN1Hj5kVs4)
3. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Vulnerability assessment within 72 hours
- **Updates**: Regular updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Security patches released according to severity
- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment (with permission)

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, privilege escalation | 24 hours |
| **High** | Data exposure, authentication bypass | 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Limited data exposure, DoS | 7 days |
| **Low** | Information disclosure, minor issues | 30 days |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Secure Implementation
```rust
// Example: Secure key handling
use biscol::prelude::*;

// ‚úÖ Good: Use secure key generation
let private_key = SecretKey::new(&mut rand::thread_rng());

// ‚ùå Bad: Never hardcode keys
// let private_key = SecretKey::from_slice(&[1; 32]).unwrap();

// ‚úÖ Good: Validate all inputs
let result = match Script::from_hex(user_input) {
    Ok(script) => script,
    Err(e) => return Err(Error::InvalidInput(e)),
};
```

#### Configuration Security
```toml
# Example: Secure configuration
[security]
# Use strong random seeds
random_seed = "system"  # Use system entropy
# Enable all security features
strict_validation = true
audit_logging = true
encrypted_storage = true
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Guidelines
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage
3. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
4. **Cryptographic Operations**: Use constant-time algorithms
5. **Logging**: Ensure no sensitive data in logs

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Cryptographic operations use approved algorithms
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Proper authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] Memory is properly cleared for sensitive data
