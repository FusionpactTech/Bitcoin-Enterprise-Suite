Title: Open-sourcing enterprise-grade Bitcoin infrastructure libraries (Rust)

Bitcoin developers! We're excited to share our Bitcoin Enterprise Suite - 4 open-source libraries designed for production Bitcoin applications.

**Background:**
We've been building Bitcoin infrastructure for enterprises over the past 2 years. Instead of keeping these tools internal, we're open-sourcing everything to accelerate Bitcoin adoption.

**Libraries:**
üîê BiSCOL - Smart contract orchestration beyond basic scripts
üåâ CCI-SAT - Atomic swaps and Lightning integration
üõ°Ô∏è AICRM-SDK - Compliance and risk management for institutions
‚ö° IMO-EO - Mining optimization and energy efficiency

**Real-world tested:**
- Processing millions in Bitcoin transactions
- Used by financial institutions
- Security audited
- Production deployed

**Why this matters:**
Enterprise Bitcoin adoption needs better tooling. These libraries provide the missing infrastructure layer for serious Bitcoin applications.

Check it out: https://github.com/FusionpactTech/Bitcoin-Enterprise-Suite

Looking forward to community feedback and contributions!

Title: Major open-source release: Enterprise Bitcoin infrastructure suite in Rust

The team at Fusionpact Technologies just open-sourced their entire Bitcoin Enterprise Suite! 

This is significant because:

1. **Production-grade**: These aren't experimental libraries - they're handling real enterprise workloads
2. **Comprehensive**: 4 libraries covering smart contracts, cross-chain, compliance, and mining
3. **Security-first**: Built with Rust, audited, and battle-tested
4. **Free**: Apache 2.0 license, completely open

**What's included:**
- Smart contract orchestration for Bitcoin
- Cross-chain atomic swaps and Lightning integration  
- AI-powered compliance and risk management
- Mining optimization algorithms

This could be a game-changer for Bitcoin enterprise adoption. The tooling has been a major barrier, and this suite addresses that directly.
